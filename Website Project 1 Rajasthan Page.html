    <h2>Instructions While Travelling To Rajasthan</h2><br>

    The state of Rajasthan has released new travel guidelines considering the ongoing situation of Covid-19 pandemic.
    While the Government lifted most of the travel restrictions in several phases post Covid-19 lockdown, the third wave
    of Covid in Rajasthan has made the Government rethink on travel guidelines.



    In a bid to deal with the second onslaught of Coronavirus, the Government has issued new restrictions on traveling
    and fines for rule-breaking. Given below are the intra-state and inter-state travel guidelines for Rajasthan. The
    information is subject to change as per the updates issued by the Rajasthan Government.

    temples and Gurudwaras don’t allow you to enter unless you cover your head. So take care of that.
    DON’TS
    Don’t accept any food or drink from your fellow passengers at any circumstances and equally do not offer your food

    Do not take pictures of people without asking permission. Photography within airports, of military installations,
    bridges and at “sensitive” border areas are not permitted.
    Do not take offers of spiritual salvation and magic remedies from saints, god men and quacks. There is no way you
    can distinguish the genuine ones from the crooks.
    Don’t encourage beggars.
    It is quite a closed society. So avoid wearing clothes that are too revealing and too scanty.
    Here is a list of some important dos and don’ts for comfortable and enjoyable travel in India.
    A proper VISA to enter and stay in India is a must. Practically every foreign national requires VISA to enter India.
    Always go with prior reservations at the hotels and arrangements of transportation, guide, safari’s etc. with the
    help of your travel agent or directly with the hotels.
    Travellers should get properly inoculated against Yellow Fever if coming through infected regions.
    It is advisable to cover yourself with travel insurance for thefts, loss and medi -claim.
    Carry proper maps of the places proposed to visit in India, as signboards are often absent. Try to reach a station
    during daytime if traveling on your own. In Any case avoid persistent touts and taxi-wallahs at airport/stations/bus
    stand to help you find your hotel. Always use tourist assistance desk for proper advice.
    Women traveling alone in certain deserted places should avoid walking at odd hours i.e after 2000 hrs in the night
    at any place.
    Don’t ever enter a temple, tomb, dargah or Gurudwara with shoes on and/or scantily dressed. One should cover his/her
    head with a cloth while in a Gurudwara or Dargah. Parikrama or walking around the sanctum sanctorum should always be
    in clockwise direction.
    Do not wear black clothes while visiting a Jain temple. Leather articles are forbidden to be carried in Hindu and
    Jain temples. Taking photograph of the deity in a temple is normally not permitted. It is always written on the
    board where the photography is prohibited.
    While changing money, insist on getting encashment certificate.
    Do not encourage beggars. You will mostly find in front of any monuments in India.

    unreasonably charged which the guest hurriedly pays without cross-checking.
    Do not leave your cash and valuables in your hotel rooms. Keep your cash divided in different pockets or security
    lockers available at the hotel.
    Take care of contamination of water and food problem. Always drink safe mineral water and take well-cooked food.
    Buy at genuine shops only. Bargaining is a popular practice in India and necessary too.
    Do not visit places which encourage orthodoxy, social injustice and inhuman practices (like visiting a sati temple).
    Don’t eat anything offered by fellow travelers on train or road travels. It might have sleeping pills. Always travel
    reserved class in trains.
    Always chain and lock your luggage under your berth in a train.
    Don’t photograph women without permission.
    Use licensed guides for sightseeing.
